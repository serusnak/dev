Start Up Document
===============

I did a search on ideas of how I could use Github and I came across this:

> "Blogs, forums, wikis and social networks solve variations of the same problem."
> https://github.com/samsquire/ideas - #4.  Living Documents in https://github.com/samsquire/ideas/README.md

He's right, you know.  What this is, it's a living document that can change its purpose in an instant.  It can be used for anything, a collection of ideas, a cookbook with recipes, or even a blog in itself!

This is a good read by Chris Coyier on different ways you can deploy a website.  But using Git makes it possible for you to deploy anything however you want!

Why not?  I'm interested in using software in creative ways, and I have a strong working knowledge of Content Management Systems.  I invested some effort in learning how to use Git because I wanted to know how to use version control software and the opportunity to be able to colloborate with other developers were too good to pass up.  I feel confident experimenting with Git now but wanted a way to record my ideas whenever I'm on a writing kick.  

So I created this document to record my ideas to try experimenting with using Git for different purposes.  I could refer to this document when I need ideas or inspiration for a creative project here or elsewhere.  To be more specific, how I could possibly use Github and Git for a project or even a goal.


Ideas of how Git can be used:
==============================
I sorted out these ideas under categories for better direction in usage of these ideas so a non-programmer could still use Github.  My list seems less intimidating this way too!  As a disclaimer, I don't know whether all of those ideas could actually be applicable using Git or other version control systems.  Those are after all just ideas, but I'd love to hear your feedback how an idea could be implemented using Git or otherwise using a real world example.  I'm just looking for a fun way to connect with folks through Github :)


Academic
----------
 
* Write a novel - (https://github.com/JJ/hoborg)
* Living document that could be a collection of journal entries
* Biblographic document with a collection of citations with sources to assist with researching for papers
* Start a proposal and colloborate with people in revising the proposal
* Make training materials for courses and workshops

Crime
------
* Assist in keeping track of forensic evidence during investigations
* Investigators could colloborate using private repos to compare notes or share files for different cases

Medicine
---------
* Patient files can be saved in repos and managed on a case by case basis.
* Journals can be kept here to keep track of a patient's history, charts and other important files with notes for reasons of change
* Fork books that's being written by researchers or doctors and always be updated whenever they add more information to their books

Career
-------

* Write your CV or resume here if you're feeling brave
* Make mini projects to show your capabilities in using Git here like working code examples or snippets to make a code portifolio

Software
---------

* News.md to keep track of changes - example can be found here at https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/NEWS or refer to news.md within /dev for an generic example.
* A collection of web files like a Wordpress Theme or boilerplate files to clone for new projects
* Software testing data logs - developers could use Git to record bugs or errors as they occur when testing software (similiar to using a news.md to document change and bug fixes but actually logging bugs as entries for this idea)
