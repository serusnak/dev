Start Up Document
===============

I did a search on ideas of how I could use Github and I came across this:

> "Blogs, forums, wikis and social networks solve variations of the same problem."
> https://github.com/samsquire/ideas - #4.  Living Documents in https://github.com/samsquire/ideas/README.md

He's right, you know.  What this is, it's a living document that can change its purpose in an instant.  It can be used for anything, a collection of ideas, a cookbook with recipes, or even a blog in itself!

Why not?  It's only fair I explain a bit about my background.  I'm interested in using software in creative ways, and I have a strong working knowledge of Content Management Systems.  I invested some effort in learning how to use Git because I wanted to know how to use version control software and the opportunity to be able to colloborate with other developers were too good to pass up.  I feel confident experimenting with Git now but wanted a way to record my ideas whenever I'm on a writing kick.  

So I created this document to record my ideas to try experimenting with using Github for different purposes.  I could refer to this document when I need ideas or inspiration for a creative project here or elsewhere.
 
 Ideas of how Github can be used:
 ================================
 
 -Write a novel (https://github.com/JJ/hoborg)
 -Living document that could be a collection of journal entries
 -A collection of web files like a Wordpress Theme
 -Biblographic document with a collection of citations with sources to assist with researching for papers
