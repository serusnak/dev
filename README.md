Introduction:
=============

What makes a good README file?  That's what this file is for.  Fill in as needed, and don't forget that you can write in Markdown.

> A introduction should be a paragraph describing what your project is.  It's good to include a brief overview to let people know what to expect from your project.

I use the term "project" loosely because it can be anything from a website to a reciepe for a cookbook.  This README.md was started as a project for myself to start learning how to use Git and I decided to make it useful for myself.  Feel free to fork it and improve the usefulness of this README.md file.  For all intents and purposes, it is a boilerplate README.md file to include with your project and edit to describe your project using this as a guide.

So far, this readme.md require nothing, as in no dependencies.  But here, you need to list all plugins and any other file dependencies like so:

#### Configure Dependencies:  instructions in following README.md files

* plugins/dropbox/README.md
* plugins/github/README.md

.. you get the idea.

Installation
-------------
Include instructions for how to install or use your project.  Make sure to provide links for quick download access and referral to third party vendors if people need to download additional files outside your project.  Especially keep this part up to date.
