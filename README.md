Introduction:

What makes a good README file?  That's what this file is for.  Fill in as needed!

A introduction should be a paragraph describing what your project is.  I use the term "project" loosely because it can be anything from a website to a reciepe for a cookbook.  It's still good to include a brief overview to let your contributors know what to expect from your project.
