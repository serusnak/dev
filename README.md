Introduction:
=============

What makes a good README file?  That's what this file is for.  Fill in as needed, and don't forget that you can write in Markdown.

> A introduction should be a paragraph describing what your project is.  It's good to include a brief overview to let people know what to expect from your project.

I use the term "project" loosely because it can be anything from a website to a reciepe for a cookbook.

So far, this readme.md require nothing, as in no dependencies.  But here, you need to list all plugins and any other file dependencies like so:

#### Configure Dependencies:  instructions in following README.md files

* plugins/dropbox/README.md
* plugins/github/README.md

.. you get the idea.

Installation
-------------
Include instructions for how to install or use your project.  Make sure to provide links for quick downloads or referencing.  Especially keep this part up to date.
